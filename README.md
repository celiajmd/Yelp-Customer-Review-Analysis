# Yelp-Customer-Review-Analysis

## Description
In this project we chose the Yelp Reviews dataset which contains 10000 observations gathered from Yelp. We mainly focused on three analysis aspects: clustering analysis, sentiment analysis, and recommendation analysis. 

## Goal
The ultimate goal is not only to help companies understand customers’ feelings and opinions in order to make adjustments and improvements on products and services but also to find relationships between customer reviews and ratings, and attract more customers in order to increase business sales.
